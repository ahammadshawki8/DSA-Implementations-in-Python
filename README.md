# Knowledge of "Data Structures and Algorithms" is one of the basic needs to become a good programmer.mmer.

In this repository, I have added many code examples of data stuctures and algorithms in python language.
This code examples are adapted from "Data Structures and Algorithm in Python" Book written by Michael T. Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia and Michael H. Goldwasser 
and also many exmples are adapted from "Cracking the Coding Interview" written by Gayle Laakmann McDowell 
and "Introduction to Algorithms" written by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, Clifford Stein.

Note that: In this repository, I haven't disscussed the codes like other repositories. So coders will have to read the books below and at the same time folow the code implementations in Python from this repository.
